        <h3>Past</h3>
        <p>There was a point in life when things were easier. The 80’s were the absolute best time to grow up. The 80’s were a time when children grew up without safety pads and participation medals. You needed to know how to interact with people. There was an unwritten rule amongst friends to never give up on anything and to try everything. Keeping your negative opinions to yourself was paramount. If you did not like something you simply excused yourself from it. Friends were vital and abundant as all the kids were outside and playing. </p>
        <h3>Present</h3>
        <p>As a husband and father, knowing honesty and integrity play a vital role within work and home life. Watching the family grow and the accomplishments of individual goals brings great happiness and pride. Showing pride and embellishing the accomplishments of family members helps create an environment for the betterment of all family members.</p>
        <h3>Future</h3>
        <h4>UNKNOWN</h4>
        <p>Although the future is unknown and never guaranteed, surrounding oneself with others who are driven and ambitious is key to future success. Wherever the road leads I will always cherish the love of my wife and children. The happiness of my family drives me forward.
