            <p>My children will never wonder if I love them. They will never wonder if I will be there when they need me. They will always know that I am their biggest fan. My wife will always know that there is nothing that I will not do for her.</p>

            <p>To Cristy:<br><br>
                Thank you, for helping me become the husband, father, and person that I am today. Thank you for never giving up on me when things seemed like they could not get any worse. You are just as beautiful today as you were on the day we met. I love you with all my heart!
